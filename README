this is my setup for terminals.  Tested only in OS X.

The color scheme is based off of ir_black from infinitered
http://blog.infinitered.com
which links to a git repository

I also liked a lot of his dotfiles, and so use those too
http://github.com/twerth/dotfiles

The command line is pretty much Phil!'s
http://aperiodic.net/phil/prompt/
with some slight modifications for os x

USAGE

My files require you to retrieve twerth's dotfiles repository 
and then run setup.sh.  
RUN setup.sh FROM ITS DIRECTORY, as in, './setup.sh'
