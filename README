this is my setup for terminals.  Tested only in OS X.

The color scheme is based off of ir_black from infinitered
http://blog.infinitered.com
which links to a git repository

I also liked a lot of his dotfiles, and so use those too
http://github.com/twerth/dotfiles

The command line is pretty much Phil!'s
http://aperiodic.net/phil/prompt/
with some slight modifications for os x

USAGE

My files require you to retrieve twerth's dotfiles repository 
and then run setup.sh.  
RUN setup.sh FROM ITS DIRECTORY, as in, './setup.sh'

I these scripts use seq, which isn't on os x for some reason
To get it, I use macports http://guide.macports.org/ and then 
sudo ln -s /opt/local/bin/gseq /opt/local/bin/seq
Seeing as how you need to install the [g]seq command anyway, 
there wasn't much use in putting this in the setup script 

Also, for the command prompt to function correctly in os x, 
you need to set the you need to set the terminal to be strict 
vt-100.  Do this by checking 'Strict VT-100 keypad behavior' 
under Terminal=>Preferences=>Settings=>Advanced

I also use Visor to have a hotkey to the terminal, which 
helpfully also includes terminal colors.  This is key 
in OS X since the dark blue is basically unreadable
in the default color.
